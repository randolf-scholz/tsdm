        We train each method on all time series of these dataset but vary the size of the training
        range $T·µ¢‚àà\{14, 21, 28\}$ days. We evaluate all the methods on the next $œÑ=7$ days after the
        forecast start time using the standard p50 and p90- quantile losses.

    NBEATS claims a key at 2014-09-01 is used. But this seems wrong.
    The date 2014-09-01 only ever occurs in Appendix A5, Figure 4&5 which show an example plot.

        For electricity we train with data between 2014-01-01 and 2014-09-01, for traffic we train
        all the data available before 2008-06-15. The results for electricity and traffic are
        computed using rolling window predictions done after the last point seen in training as
        described in [23]. We do not retrain our model for each window, but use a single model
        trained on the data before the first prediction window.

        5.1 Forecasting
        [...]
        For electricity and traffic, we consider the 24-hour ahead forecasting task and use last
        seven days as the test periods.

        A.1 Datasets and Evaluation Criteria
        [...]
        electricity 3 : the electricity usage in kW recorded every 15 minutes, for n = 370 clients.
        We convert the data to reflect hourly consumption, by aggregating blocks of 4 columns,
        to obtain T = 26, 304. Teh coefficient of variation for electricity is 6.0341.

    .. epigraph::

        For short-term forecasting, we evaluate rolling-day forecasts for seven days ( i.e.,
        prediction horizon is one day and forecasts start time is shifted by one day after
        evaluating the prediction for the current day [6]). For long-term forecasting, we directly
        forecast 7 days ahead.

        A.2 Training
        [...]
        For electricity-c and traffic-c, we take 500K training windows while for electricity-f and
        traffic-f, we select 125K and 200K training windows, respectively.

        A.3 Evaluation
        Following the experimental settings in [6], one week data from 9/1/2014 00:00 (included) 9
        on electricity-c and 6/15/2008 17:00 (included) 10 on traffic-c is left as test sets.
        For electricity-f and traffic-f dataset, one week data from 8/31/2014 00:15 (included) and
        6/15/2008 17:00 (included) 11 is left as test sets, respectively.
