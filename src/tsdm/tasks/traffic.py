    Evaluation Protocol
    -------------------

        Traffic: Tests on the Traffic dataset are also kept consistent with previous work, using
        500k training samples taken before 2008-06-15 as per [9], and key in the same way as the
        Electricity dataset. For testing, we use the 7 days immediately following the training set,
        and z-score normalization was applied across all entities. For inputs, we also take traffic
        occupancy, day-of-week, hour-of-day and a time index as real-valued inputs, and the
        entity identifier as a categorical variable.

        5.1 Forecasting
        [...]
        For electricity and traffic, we consider the 24-hour ahead forecasting task and use last
        seven days as the test periods.


        A.1 Datasets and Evaluation Criteria
        [...]
        traffic 4 : A collection of 15 months of daily data from the California Department of
        Transportation. The data describes the occupancy rate, between 0 and 1, of different car
        lanes of San Francisco Bay Area freeways. The data was sampled every 10 minutes, and we
        again aggregate the columns to obtain hourly traffic data to finally get n = 963,
        T = 10, 560. The coefficient of variation for traffic is 0.8565.
