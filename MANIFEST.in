# These files will be included in the sdist.
# At installation time, only those files will be kept that are also part of a
# python package (folder with __init__.py). A bdist_wheel will only contain
# these to begin with.
# This is intended behaviour and as of the time of writing there is no way to
# include non-package files in the wheel, cf. setuptools documentation v57.0.0
