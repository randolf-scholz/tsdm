# Notes on Documentation

There are many different packages for sphinx to automatically build documentation

- autodoc
- autodoc2
- autoapi
- automodapi
- autoapisummary
- autosummary + recursion <https://github.com/JamesALeedham/Sphinx-Autosummary-Recursion/tree/master>
- autopackagesummary

Some comparison of features we want:

- single page per class / function
- nicely formatted signatures
  - abbreviated typehints
  - PEP 695 style typehints
- links to properly formatted source code

TODOS:

- links to source code missing?!

FINDINGS:

- `autosummary` doesn't work well.
  - methods are missing
  - links to source code missing
  - ...
  - it is decently fast though
  - probably some template customization required.
- `autoapi` is nice for creating separate pages per class/function/method
  - very slow compile times though...
  - hyperlinks missing
